# Traffic_Volume_Prediction_R
## Problem statement
Predict the traffic volume in a particular area based on weather features with date and time data by training the model using and comparing different algorithms.

## Data Set Information:
Hourly Interstate 94 Westbound traffic volume for MN DoT ATR station 301, roughly midway between Minneapolis and St Paul, MN. Hourly weather features and holidays included for impacts on traffic volume.

## Algorithms:
1. Multiple linear regression: Multiple Linear Regression is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and more than one independent variable.
2. Decision trees: A tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.
3. Random forest: Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset. The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.
4. Gradient boosting: Gradient Boosting is a powerful boosting algorithm that combines several weak learners into strong learners, in which each new model is trained to minimize the loss function such as mean squared error of the previous model using gradient descent.
5. ARIMA: "Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average", refers to a class of models that uses a time series' own previous values—specifically, its own lags and lagged prediction errors—to explain the time series in order to predict future values.
